# Capitán Sevilla 3D

Capitán Sevilla 3D is a tribute and sequel to Hi-Score's and Dinamic Software's 
Capitán Sevilla for Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum and MSX from 1988. It's a humorous side-
scrolling action platformer where you jump and shoot your way through a total of 4 areas.

Under the name of “Capitán Sevilla 2”, the original demo by Rubén Garcerá Soto won 
2nd prize in the PVB Coding Competition 2010. 

Starting in 2018, the game has been rebuilt from the ground up, based on the VUEngine 
Platformer Demo, under the new name “Capitán Sevilla 3D”. Since the original demo was 
2D-only, all the environments have been remastered in 3-D by the VUEngine team. 

This demo contains all the content of the original 2010 demo, with remastered graphics, new 
sprites and animations, updated game mechanics, many sounds and music and much more.
