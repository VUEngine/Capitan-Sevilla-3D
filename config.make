# debug:				Adds lots of runtime assertions. Enables debugging tools too.
# 						It is recommended to use the sram sections for the memory pools
# 						when debugging in order to avoid stack overflows
# 						(SRAM as WRAM only works on emulators).
# tools:				Adds debugging tools without all the debug checking.
# beta:					Removes most asserts. For testing the performance on hardware.
# release:				Removes all asserts. For shipping only!

# Sections' usage
# SRAM's usage
# You can use SRAM as WRAM. It adds, theoretically, 16MB of WRAM where all non initialized variables can be allocated.
# This feature is experimental and only works properly on emulators.
# Since only 8KB of SRAM is available on real carts, more than that will only work on emulators.
# To make effective any change to these options, the whole project needs to be recompiled.
# DRAM can be used as WRAM too, you must edit the linker script vb.ld to accommodate this
# taking into account that the Param Table's last address normally is 0x0003D800, where
# the WORLD attributes start.
